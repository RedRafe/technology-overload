[mod-setting-description]
to-difficulty=Select a difficulty preset for the technology tech tree. Preset have default parameters that can be changed by setting allowing customization below . Please refer to the mod portal for each game mode description
to-searchDept=If checked, substitute each tech cost by the cumulative sum of previous researched techs
to-applyDepth=If checked, enables the DEPTH MULTIPLIER (multiplies each tech cost by the depth of that thechnology along the tech tree)
to-treeCoefficient=Multiplies each tech cost by the depth of that thechnology along the tech tree (5th tech:  cost times 5)
to-depthExp=Raises the DEPTH MULTIPLIER by DEPTH EXPONENT (DMultiplier ^ DExponent)
to-inverseDepth=Slow start, fast endgame. Funnel mode reverses the depth cumputation: endgame technologies are 1x the original cost, while previous technologies are multiplied by the distance (inverse depth) to that technology.
to-allowCustomization=If checked, overvrites default parameters with the ones you choose below
